# 🔐 VADER: Versatile Accelerated Digital Encryption Recovery 🚀

 📖 Introduction
VADER (Versatile Accelerated Digital Encryption Recovery) is a powerful and efficient tool designed to aid in the recovery of encrypted passwords for legitimate purposes. This project leverages the parallel processing capabilities of GPUs and multi-core CPUs using OpenCL to accelerate the password recovery process significantly.

## 🔑 Key Features
- 🚀 Accelerated password recovery using OpenCL for parallel processing
- 💻 Supports both GPU and CPU execution
- 📚 Dictionary-based attack with the option to include user-specific biographical data
- 🕰️ Significantly faster than traditional sequential methods
- 💯 100% accuracy in recovering passwords
- 👥 User-friendly graphical interface (GUI) for easy interaction

## 🛠️ Installation
- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/quetojenkins/YODA_EmbeddedProject_2024.git
- Install the required dependencies (e.g., OpenCL, Python, C++ compiler)
- Build the project
- Run the executable or launch the GUI

## 🚀 Usage
- Enter the MD5 hashed password you want to recover
- Select or provide a dictionary file containing potential passwords
- (Optional) Upload a text file with biographical information to enhance the dictionary
- Start the recovery process
- Wait for the program to find the plaintext password
- The recovered password will be displayed in the GUI or printed to the console
